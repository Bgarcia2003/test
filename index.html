      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p><strong>Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón</strong> was born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Mexico. However, she claimed she was born in 1910, the year of the Mexican Revolution, as she saw herself as a child of the revolution and its social, nationalist, and cultural identity changes.</p>
      <p>At the age of 6, she contracted polio and was bedridden for nine months. This disease caused her right leg and foot to become noticeably thinner than her left. After recovering, she developed a limp and wore long skirts for the rest of her life to conceal it.</p> 
      <p>Frida had a close relationship with her father, Guillermo Kahlo, a photographer who encouraged her artistic pursuits. He worked in photography for over 50 years until epilepsy-related health issues forced him to stop.</p>

      <p><i>Originally</i>, Frida was studying to become a doctor, but in 1925, at the age of 18, she suffered a near-fatal bus accident. She sustained multiple broken bones and was impaled by an iron railing, leaving her bedridden for months.</p>
      <p>During her recovery, her mother, <strong>Matilde Calderón</strong>, encouraged her to paint. She arranged an easel and mirror for Frida, allowing her to paint while confined to bed. While she was starting to unleash her inner artist, Frida started creating intensely personal artwork. Her first significant recognition came in 1929 with her solo exhibition in Mexico, where her self-portraits, depicting her physical and emotional pain, caught the attention of prominent artists, including Diego Rivera.</p>
